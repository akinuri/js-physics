# Simple Physics in JS

I started learning JavaScript because I wanted to animate a solar system. And I did that. So animation (or rather physics) is one of my early interests. I revisit this topic from time to time, and create many experiments. However, they are all scattered in my disks. I dislike disorder, so I decided to gather all the info I acquired in one place.

I'll also be refactoring, and create abstractions. This might take a while.

Oh, and I'm talking about 2D.
